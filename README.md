</p>
<p>Hey, World!</p>

Over here you will find some of my [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) challenges done or at least on the way to be done.
There is always references with links to youtube, stackoverFlow or any other place that I found answers before hit my head in the wall cos I cloudn't do it by myself. :grin:
<h4> But, What is CodeWars :question: :eyes: </h4>
It's a website where you face challenges and you get leveled by how good you do. It isn't limited to JavaScript or any or the languages you can find in this repositore.
<h4> Have a look how the ranking or level of difficulty works :trophy: </h4>
From 8 to 1 where 8 is the easiest and 1 is the hard core mode :game_die:
