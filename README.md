## CodeWars - (JavaScript) :bomb: :computer:  ðŸ¤¯

Hey, World!

Over here you will find some of my [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) challenges done or at least on the way to be done.

There is always references with links to youtube, stackoverFlow or any other place that I found answers before hit my head in the wall cos I cloudn't do it by myself. :grin:

#### But, What is CodeWars :question: :eyes:
It's a website where you face challenges and you get leveled by how good you do. It isn't limited to JavaScript or any or the languages you can find in this repositore.
